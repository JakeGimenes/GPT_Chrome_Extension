<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Chat GPT-4 currently only allows 40 queries every 3 hours, an abysmal amount for the steep price of $20 a month. You can get around this by simply using the API, but then you'd have to type questions into an IDE...
Luckily we've built a Chrome extension that enables users to use a GUI interface for access GPT-4 via API calls, designed to bypass token limits and reduce subscription costs. 


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get the extension up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Get an API Key at [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Clone the repo or download the project as a zip
3. In Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/ and enable Developer Mode in the top right of the page
4. Click Load unpacked at the top left of the page
5. Select the folder containing the repo and click OK


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After loading the extension, I strongly recommend you pin it to the search bar by opening the extension menu and clicking the pin icon. Now you should be able to easily open it from any page.
To use GPT in your Chrome browser, simply click the icon, enter your API key, and then type a question like you would using OpenAI's page.
